# ai_search_lab

This project focuses on optimizing search algorithms using various strategies and techniques to find the optimal percentage for the delete function, achieving the highest increase in write latency. It includes two main Python scripts: `search.py`, which contains the core search algorithm implementation for loading datasets, performing search operations, and measuring write latency, and `searchAgents.py`, which includes various search agents (Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Particle Swarm Optimization, Machine Learning-Based Search) to enhance the search process. To set up the project, clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install the required dependencies. You can run the core search algorithm with `python search.py` and execute specific search agents with `python searchAgents.py --agent AgentName`. Contributions are welcome and the project is licensed under the MIT License.
